rPI_audio_board
===============
best current version to build is v0.4 (updated 22 Aug 2013)
-------------------------------------
a rPi daughter board for high quality audio io 

This is a developing extension board for the raspberry pi model rev.B

It is intended for use with aSOC i2s audio drivers and requires a kernel build, which you can read more about at my blog or on the raspberry pi forums.

This is also an experiment with using github for hardware file sharing and revision control. I hope others will join me developing this hardware as an opensource project and work with github to facilitate the collabortation.

This is meant to be an open source hardware project under the creative commons license, but I haven't got around to figuring out what that actually means yet.
